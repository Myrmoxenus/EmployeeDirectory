## Description:
Completed as a homework assignment for Washington University's Fullstack Web Development Program. The purpose of this assignment was to make an employee registry table in React that could be sorted and filtered by managing component state in response to user events.

## Installation: 
First run npm install to install the required npm dependencies. From there, the application can be run from the command line using "npm run start". Application is also deployed [here on Heroku.
](https://employee-directory-homework.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage:
Upon start up the application will call an API to generate 10 random employees. Under the table there are two buttons. The first button allows the user to sort the list in either ascending or descending order according to the employee's surname. The second allows the user to toggle a filter that swaps between male and female employees.
